% find that FAST features and SURF extraction works exceptionally well....
% The FAST feature detection is tuned to be fairly "permissible"; that is,
% we specify low values of MinQuality and MinContrast to return a lot of
% matches. We will then match the test image against each training set, and
% consider that we "recognize" the match that minimizes our metric (Sum of
% Absolute Differences, or SAD).
